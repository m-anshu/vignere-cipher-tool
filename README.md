# Vigenère Cipher Tool

## Description
The Vigenère Cipher Tool is a simple and intuitive application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Vigenère cipher technique. This classical encryption method uses a keyword to shift letters in the plaintext, providing a more secure alternative to the Caesar cipher.

## Features
- Encrypt plaintext using a keyword.
- Decrypt ciphertext back to plaintext.
- Supports double layer encryption and decryption.
- Interface for use on terminal.

## Example showcase
Files showing the working of the cipher.
- file1.txt shows the original message.
- file2.txt shows the encrypted message.
- file3.txt shows the decrypted message.
